	<p>Consider us your open source consultants. We produce the same useless documents but you don&#39;t have to pay us. Everything which is produced by BlackHat Squirrel is open source, it&#39;s completely free to use without restriction under the sole condition that you credit us somewhere along the way. If you want to contribute then even better, add / amend / ruin and share with the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The best place to find all this garbage is our github page (https://github.com/blackhatsquirrel) but we&#39;ll be posting various extracts here in the form of poorly thought through blog posts and random internet rants. MASSIVE shout out to Hank Quinlan&#39;s excellent walk through which taught me how to use Jekyll!&nbsp;</p>

	<p>You can find some of the latest posts below and there&#39;s an RSS feed hidden here somewhere as well... I&#39;m just not 100% sure where I actually put it.&nbsp;</p>
