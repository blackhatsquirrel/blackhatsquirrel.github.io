We&rsquo;re all really excited about plugging in sexy new boxes with flashy lights but when it comes to actually running the damn things we&rsquo;re at a loss. Even approaching what you&rsquo;re meant to do is a nightmare. Does it include patching? Are we a hunt team? Is it more than just a SOC? These are all questions which you&rsquo;ve no doubt ignored in the interest of avoiding as much work as possible. Fortunately we&rsquo;ve come up with a very straightforward way of explaining to your boss what you&rsquo;re meant to do. Whether or not what you&rsquo;re meant to do is what you&rsquo;re actually doing is another story&hellip; </span></span></span></span></p>
